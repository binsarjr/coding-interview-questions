Given an array of positive and negative numbers. Find if there is a subarray (of size at-least one) with 0 sum.

Example 1:
Input:
5
4 2 -3 1 6
Output: 
Yes
Explanation: 
2, -3, 1 is the subarray 
with sum 0.

Example 2:
Input:
5
4 2 0 1 6
Output: 
Yes
Explanation: 
0 is one of the element 
in the array so there exist a 
subarray with sum 0.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n).

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 104
-105 <= a[i] <= 105

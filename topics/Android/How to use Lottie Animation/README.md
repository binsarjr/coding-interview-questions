**What is lottie?**
```
A Lottie is a JSON-based animation file format that enables designers
to ship animations on any platform as easily as shipping static assets.
They are small files that work on any device and can scale up or down without pixelation.

It’s easier than you think, with LottieFiles you can import and preview your Lottie animation and 
it will generate the lines of code that you can use to implement your animations in your projects.
Alternatively, you can also download Lottie animations from our community and marketplace.
